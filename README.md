# ft_ality

## TODO

-   [ ] `--mode=normal|debug|gui` with normal as default
-   [ ] gui
-   [ ] check parsing
-   [ ] simple tester (even just `make valid` and `make invalid`)
-   [ ] the inputs should always be processed line by line
-   [ ] make everything tail-recursive or use higher-order functions

## Code

-   [ ] all recursion is tail-recursive
-   [ ] the inputs should always be processed line by line
-   [ ] no function bigger than 20 lines
-   [ ] no utility functions at the module level, everything is nested
-   [ ] modules (should not export unnecessary functions)
-   [ ] no exceptions
